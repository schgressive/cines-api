# Cines API

An attempt at an open JSON API with movie showtimes for chilean movie theaters. Since none of the websites provide an API for this I thought I'd make my own.

# Requirements

  * Ruby 2.3.1 (though it might work on other versions)
  * MongoDB

# How to run it

First, populate the DB by running:

```
rake update
```

Then run a local instance:

```
rake server
```

You should be able to use any Rack-compatible server, since I included a config.ru file.

# How to use it

The server has just two methods:

### GET /theaters

It returns a list of theaters, along with their names and URLs:

```
[
    {
        "id": "508b4bcf67e6e2a56e000001",
        "name": "Alto las Condes",
        "lat": 0,
        "lng": 0
    },
    {
        "id": "508b4bd067e6e2a56e000019",
        "name": "Plaza Oeste",
        "lat": 0,
        "lng": 0
    }
]
```

### GET /theaters/:id/movies

Returns a list of movies on that theater, with their showtimes:

```
[
    {
        "name": "(Pre) Siniestro (Subtitulada)",
        "showtimes": [
            "21:40",
            "00:20"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "360  (Subtitulada)",
        "showtimes": [
            "19:45"
        ]
    },
]
```

# What's Next?

It currently only parses Cinemark and Cine Hoyts, so there's that. Here's a list of what's coming:

  * Movie theater locations
  * More movie theaters
